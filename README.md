## Book Summary

An introduction to the programming of interactive computer graphics, with a particular focus on game development, is provided in this book using Direct3D 12. It imparts the fundamentals of Direct3D and shader programming, which will equip the reader to pursue more complex techniques. The book is organised into three primary sections. The mathematical instruments that will be employed in this book are delineated in Part I. Part II demonstrates the implementation of essential Direct3D tasks, including initialisation, defining 3D geometry, setting up cameras, constructing vertex, pixel, geometry, and compute shaders, lighting, texturing, blending, stencilling, and tessellation. Part III is primarily concerned with the application of Direct3D to create a diverse array of captivating techniques and special effects, including the use of geometry, character animation, picking, particle systems, environment mapping, normal mapping, real-time shadows, and ambient occlusion.
