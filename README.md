# Introduction to Game Programming with DirectX12
##### By [Frank D. Luna](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/2988380)
## Project Description
During my time at university, we employed DirectX extensively, beginning with an introduction to DirectX9. In the latter years of my course, we transitioned to the use of DirectX11 to construct a number of larger projects. It became evident that these projects were not readily viewable in their current state due to the use of numerous obsolete interfaces when they were updated to be viewed via GitHub. This has motivated me to pursue this book in order to enhance my understanding of the graphics API in accordance with the most recent version. While simultaneously incorporating more prevalent contemporary C++ techniques into the implementation. An occasion to demonstrate my development as a programmer during my tenure in the industry. This project is presently on hold as I am in the process of updating my dissertation project using comparable methodologies.\
Once this project is completed the following projects will be updated:
- [Hierarchical Animation in Computer Graphics]()
- [Real Time Collisions Handling]()

## Book Summary
![Book](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42b1bc2b-d4c8-4c88-8e51-8831f0960ba4)

An introduction to the programming of interactive computer graphics, with a particular focus on game development, is provided in this book using Direct3D 12. It imparts the fundamentals of Direct3D and shader programming, which will equip the reader to pursue more complex techniques. The book is organised into three primary sections. The mathematical instruments that will be employed in this book are delineated in Part I. Part II demonstrates the implementation of essential Direct3D tasks, including initialisation, defining 3D geometry, setting up cameras, constructing vertex, pixel, geometry, and compute shaders, lighting, texturing, blending, stencilling, and tessellation. Part III is primarily concerned with the application of Direct3D to create a diverse array of captivating techniques and special effects, including the use of geometry, character animation, picking, particle systems, environment mapping, normal mapping, real-time shadows, and ambient occlusion.
